    <p>Modern society has increasingly integrated technology into daily life, with people of all age groups utilizing technology in various ways. The accessibility and range of technology has expanded significantly in recent times, leading to more prevalent usage by different age groups.

        Younger generations are encountering smartphones, tablets, and digital devices as an ever-present factor in their lives. They heavily rely on technology for entertainment, education, and communication, which has an impact on their development and behavior.
        
        A few weeks ago, we made a survey focusing on the use of social media of different age groups. This survey contains questions regarding the social media app they use the most, their age, their sex, and the time they usually spend on social media in a day. </p>
